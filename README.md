# Real-Time Text Analysis

This React app provides real-time word and character counts, along with string replacement. It's a great tool for writers, editors, and anyone who needs to analyze text.

## Features

- **Real-Time Word Count**: Displays the number of unique words in the textarea, treating words case-insensitively.
- **Character Count**: Shows the number of characters entered, excluding spaces and punctuation.
- **String Replacement**: Allows users to search for a specific string and replace it with another string. The replacement is case-sensitive.
- **Bonus Feature**: Highlights the replaced words in the textarea after the replacement.

## Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components and Hooks)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
